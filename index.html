    <h1>Hi love ‚ù§Ô∏è</h1>
    <p>These past 6 months have flown by in a blink of an eye, but I am honestly not surprised. Every second with you has truly felt with a dream, and the way time passes when I am with you does not feel real.
    With you I am constantly laughing, energized, and most importantly I always feel like being myself Even though you try to stick your fingers up my butt occasionally I will always love yout with all of my heart. Not just that 
    but even with all the love I have for you this love manages to grow stronger and stronger each day. Jess you make me realize that I have found my person. And I love this person(its you btw) with all of my heart and more. I love this 
    person more than there are combinations in a deck of cards. I am so glad I have the honor to be yours and I cannot wait for endless memories with my person. I love you!</p>
